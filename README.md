# Project 1
My code is a basically a weather information world, where it takes different types of input and give different outputs.
So, the user has 3 options, number 1 is they will put in Celsius and the code will convert it into Fahrenheit and the opposite. 
Second option is the user will input their weekly weather degrees and the code will tell them the average.
Third is weather predictor, as the user inputs a month name such as January, Februaryâ€¦. The code will guess what the average temperature of that month would be based on the data I provided it earlier. (the code might give different results for the same months)


When you are done, delete everything else on this page. It is only here for reference.
